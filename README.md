# Rat in a Maze Visualizer

This project showcases my algorithmic problem-solving skills using backtracking to solve the Rat in a Maze problem, integrated with a web page through DOM manipulation.

## Overview

The Rat in a Maze problem involves finding a path for a rat from the starting position to the goal position in a maze. This project provides an interactive visualization of how backtracking can be used to solve this problem. Users can set custom start and destination points, create their own mazes, and visualize the solving process directly on a web page.

## Features

- **Interactive Maze:** Set start and destination points, and create custom mazes.
- **Backtracking Algorithm:** Demonstrates the backtracking technique for solving maze problems.
- **User Guide:** Includes a detailed guide for using the interface.
- **Responsive Design:** Works well across different devices and screen sizes.
